## OAuth Credentials

OAuth 2 requires that clients have a `client_id` and a `client_secret`.

The `client_id` is an identifier for an individual client.
It doesn't need to be kept secret.

The `client_secret` is a secret for proving to Moxi Works that requests are coming from the client they claim to be.
It must not be shared with any party other than Moxi Works.
That includes sending it to the end user's browser and sharing with other third-party services.

Contact your account manager to get a `client_id` and `client_secret` for your application.
If there are third-party services that need access to Moxi Works' authentication service, contact your account manager to get a `client_id` and `client_secret` for them as well.

When you get your `client_id` and `client_secret`, you will also need to provide a list of valid `redirect_uri`s.
These are the allowed locations to communicate information about the user's authentication state back to clients.
Checking this list against a whitelist is a requirement of the OAuth 2 protocol.
The requirement exists to make sure that no information about end users is leaked to unauthorized parties.
A single `redirect_uri` is common, but more can be added if desired.
This list can be updated at any time.
Contact your account manager for assistance.
