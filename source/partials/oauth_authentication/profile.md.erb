## Obtaining End User Profiles

An access token can be used to get information about an end user.

<aside class="note">Send a <b>GET</b> request to https://sso.moxiworks.com/agent/profile</aside>

The request is gated by the presence of an OAuth 2 access token.

To send the access token in the request, add an `Authorization` HTTP header with a value of `Bearer <access_token>`.

If the access token has expired or is otherwise invalid, the server responds with a `401 Unauthorized` status.

If the access token was valid, a JSON object is returned:

| Attribute | Type | Remark |
|-----------|------|--------|
| <span class="required-data">display_name</span> | <span class="data-type">String</span> | <span class="data-remarks">The end user's display name</span> |
| <span class="required-data">user_id</span> | <span class="data-type">String</span> | <span class="data-remarks">A string that uniquely identifies the end user</span> |
| <span class="required-data">email</span> | <span class="data-type">String</span> | <span class="data-remarks">The end user's email address</span> |

More fields may be added to this in the future.
Consumers of this data should not fail if more fields are present in the result.
